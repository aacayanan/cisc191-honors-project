    <h2 id="introhead">Introduction</h2>
    <p>When working with objects in Java, it is important to understand the difference between shallow and deep copies.
        Before we get into the differences, we need to understand what an object is. In Java, an object is an instance
        of a class and
        is essential for use of attributes and methods of the class. <br> <br>
        Consider the following example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        // Define a class named Car
        public class Car {
            // Attributes
            String make;
            String model;
            int year;
            String color;

            // Constructor
            public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color) {
                this.make = make;
                this.model = model;
                this.year = year;
                this.color = color;
            }

            // Method to drive the car
            public void drive() {
                System.out.println("Vroom vroom!");
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, we created a class named Car with instance variables 'brand', 'model', and 'year'. The class
        has a constructor 'Car()' to initalize the instance variables when an object is created. We also created a
        method
        'drive()' that prints "Vroom vroom!" to the console when called. <br> <br>
        Using this example, an object created with is class will consist of:
    <ol>
        <li>Identity: the unique name to an object that will be associated with the 'Car' class and is used to
            distinguish it from other objects as well as interact with other objects.</li>
        <li>State: which represents the attributes of an object, used to reflect the properties of the created object.
        </li>
        <li>Behavior: which represents the methods of the object, which is used to interact with other objects.</li>
    </ol>
    Example of an object: myCar
    </p>
    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <th>Identity</th>
            <th>State/Attributes</th>
            <th>Behavior</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Name of Car</th>
            <th>Make<br>
                Model<br>
                Year<br>
                Color</th>
            <th>
                Drive
            </th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Essentially, objects serve as the connection between classes. A class functions as a blueprint outlining
        the program's behavior and structure during execution. It incorporates all the instances and methods
        that may be utilized within the program. On the other hand, objects encapsulate data utilized for
        interaction with other objects.

<div class="thewhy">
    <h2 id="whyhead">Why do we even need copies?</h2>
    <p>Now that we understand objects and classes, why should we even bother with copies? <br>
        There are many reasons as to why we may need to utilize copies in Java and object-oriented programming.
        Some reasons include: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating a backup of an object.</li>
        <li>Creating a new object with the same attributes as another object.</li>
        <li>Creating a new object with the same attributes as another object, but with different values.</li>
        <br> or specific reasons like<br> <br>
        <li>Managing a stock inventory system.</li>
        <li>Duplicating initial conditions for independent outcomes.</li>
        <li>Copying game saves or copies of save files without losing progress.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="shallow">
    <h2 id="shallowhead">Shallow Copy</h2>
    <p>A shallow copy is a bit misleading. It is not a copy at all, but rather a reference to the original object.
        When a shallow copy is made, the new object will point to the same memory location as the original object.
        This means that any changes made to the new object will also affect the original object. <br> <br>
        Consider the following example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        // Create a new object
        Car myCar = new Car("Lucid", "Air", 2024, "Space Gray");

        // Create a shallow copy of the object
        Car myCarCopy = myCar;
    </pre>
    <p>When we create a shallow copy of 'myCar', 'myCarCopy' will point to the same memory location as 'myCar'.
        This means that any changes made to 'myCarCopy' will also affect 'myCar'. <br> <br>
        This is useful when we want to create a new object with the same attributes as another object, but we need to
        be careful when making changes to the new object. <br> <br>
